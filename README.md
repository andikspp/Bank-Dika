# Bank-Dika
Bank Dika is a Banking Management System that allows users to perform various banking activities such as transferring money, making deposits, and more. This system has three roles: Customer, Teller, and Admin. It is a portfolio project from my "Learning by Doing" journey to learn Java Spring Boot.
